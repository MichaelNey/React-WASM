# React WASM

This project is to simply demonstrate usage of Web Assembly functions in React. This not best practice, and should not be used in production.

In the demo, you can see two boxes. One on the left, and one on the right. The Web Assembly in this project is compiled from raw C code. The speed benefits from Web Assembly over Javascript are very noticeable.
